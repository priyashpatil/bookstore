# Development Approach & Philosophy

The project was started with a problem statement and research for the solution. Starting with writing down bare minimum
requirements of the application. After understanding the requirements, I started with designing the Database and
arranging the basic building blocks for tech stack along with referencing the UI designs.

While starting the development, I took the production first philosophy to ensure I had the ability to deploy the updates
as I start developing on more features than just bare minimum requirements.

## The development Phases

The split the application development phases to gradually add feature starting phase 1 as a bare minimum.
